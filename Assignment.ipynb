    "1. (easy) Write an SQL query to retrieve the full names (first name and last name) and email addresses of all customers who have registered in the database since January 1, 2023.\n",
    "2. Calculate the lifetime value of each customer. Lifetime value is defined as the total sum of orders placed by each customer from their first order to the present. The query should return the customer's first name, last name, and their lifetime value, sorted by lifetime value in descending order.\n",
    "3. Construct a SQL query to identify customers who placed orders in their first month but did not place any orders in the subsequent month. The query should return the CustomerID, first name, last name, and the date of their last order. Additionally, provide a count of how many orders were placed in the first month of their activity.\n",
    "4. Devise a SQL query that lists each customer along with their most recent order details. The output should include the customer's first name, last name, and the details of their most recent order (OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, and OrderStatus). Additionally, calculate the number of days that have elapsed since their last order. Sort the results by the elapsed days in ascending order.\n",

    "- OrderStatus (VARCHAR): The status of the order (e.g., \"Pending\", \"Shipped\", \"Delivered\").\n",
    "\n",
    "These tables are connected via the CustomerID in the Orders table, which acts as a foreign key referencing the CustomerID in the Customers table.

      "1. Join the `Customers` and `Orders` tables using the `CustomerID`.\n",
      "2. For each customer, identify the most recent order. This can be done by finding the maximum `OrderDate` for each customer.\n",
